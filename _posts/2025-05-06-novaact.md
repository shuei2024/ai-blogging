**Nova Act** is Amazon’s latest AI model designed to perform real, reliable actions inside web browsers-ushering in a new era of “actionbots” that go beyond chat to actually *do* things for you. Unlike traditional conversational AI, Nova Act is built to automate tasks like shopping, booking appointments, filling forms, and handling complex web interactions with a focus on accuracy and predictability.

## What Makes Nova Act Different?

- **Atomic Commands for Reliability:** Instead of tackling vague, high-level tasks in one go, Nova Act lets developers break workflows into small, explicit steps (like “click Submit” or “select Option 3”). Each step is executed through the Nova Act SDK, significantly boosting reliability over end-to-end automation.
- **Natural Language Control:** You can instruct Nova Act in plain English, including nuanced directions like “don’t accept the insurance upsell,” making it flexible for real-world scenarios.
- **Python Integration:** Developers can interleave Python code for testing, parallelization, and advanced logic, allowing for robust, automated workflows.
- **Screen Awareness:** Nova Act is trained to deeply understand web page structures, enabling it to handle tricky UI elements such as date pickers, dropdowns, and popups-areas where other agents often fail.

## Benchmark Performance

Nova Act sets a new standard for reliability in browser automation:

| Benchmark                    | Nova Act | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | OpenAI CUA |
|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| ScreenSpot Web TextFollow    | 0.939    | 0.900             | 0.883      |
| ScreenSpot Web IconFollow    | 0.879    | 0.854             | 0.806      |
| GroundUI Web                | 0.805    | 0.825             | 0.823      |

Nova Act consistently outperforms or matches leading competitors, especially in following natural language instructions and interacting with complex UI elements.

## Real-World Impact

Nova Act isn’t just a research project-it’s already demonstrating practical value:

- **For individuals:** Automates online shopping, reschedules appointments, cancels subscriptions, and more-all without manual clicks.
- **For businesses:** Handles IT tickets, monitors inventory, scrapes competitor data, and automates routine web-based workflows.

## Why It Matters

By focusing on reliability and composability, Nova Act addresses the biggest hurdle in agentic AI: trust. It’s a shift from “chat with AI” to “delegate to AI,” enabling users and developers to confidently hand off digital tasks and focus on higher-value work.

Nova Act is currently available as a research preview for developers, with the potential to reshape how we interact with the web-moving from passive chatbots to truly capable digital assistants.

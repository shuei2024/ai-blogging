## **What Is Uplodio?**

Uplodio is an innovative AI influencer manager designed to automate and streamline creator marketing operations for marketing teams and enterprises. At its core is "Amy," an AI agent that acts as a virtual team member—handling everything from creator discovery and outreach to negotiation, onboarding, and campaign management. This allows brands to scale from managing a handful of creators to hundreds, all without the manual workload that typically bogs down marketing teams.

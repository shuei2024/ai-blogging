Abeja platform is also used to create the "Human in the Loop" approach, achieving Zero PoC (Proof of Concept) for driving Digital Transformation (DX) with AI. The reason is projects get stuck at PoC and fail to reach production for reasons such as the AI's accuracy not improving as expected or the inability to afford consistent investment. In the initial phase, when operational expertise and data are insufficient, humans are primarily responsible for decision-making, but as the steps progress, the involvement of humans and AI can change. Customers can use AI in their business processes right from the start, and humans can nurture AI in the operational process. This accelerates the transformation to an AI-powered business process and the AI training cycle, resulting in faster and more sophisticated progression to actual live operations.

There are 4 steps/phases in the process of Abeja platform for a digital transformation process as followed:

1. **Step 1**: Executed by human

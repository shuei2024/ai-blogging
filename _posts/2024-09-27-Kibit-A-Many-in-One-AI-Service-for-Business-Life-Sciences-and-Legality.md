## Life Sciences with Drug Discovery AI Factory

FRONTEO's "Drug Discovery AI Factory" leverages the KIBIT AI engine, alongside a team of seasoned biologists and data scientists, to enhance the efficiency, speed, and success rates of drug discovery research. This service identifies novel target molecules, biomarkers, and mechanisms of action (MoA) through comprehensive data analysis. By employing AI, KIBIT accelerates the traditionally lengthy research processes, delivering scientifically grounded proposals in significantly shorter timeframes, thus revolutionizing drug discovery through innovative AI applications. The main focus of "Drug Discovery AI Factory" covers 4 sectors:
- Target Discovery/Selection

- Hypothesis Generation

- Drug Repositioning

- Evaluation of in-licensed/licensed products

In FRONTEO, a team of researchers with extensive knowledge in the life sciences field is using AI engines and applications developed in-house to create innovative and highly original analysis methods called "Drug Discovery Best Known Methods (DD-BKM)." By gaining a deep understanding of customer needs through dialogue and optimally utilizing DD-BKM based on that understanding, they accelerate our customers' drug discovery research throughout 5 methods:
 - Duplicate difference analysis

 - Two-dimensional mapping analysis

 - Vector addition analysis

 - Multifaceted analysis

 - Virtual Experiments

### FRONTEO's Forensic Investigations

Forensic analysis, originally used in legal investigations, now refers to collecting and analyzing data from computers and networks to uncover evidence of crimes such as fraud or data breaches. Digital forensics has gained prominence, particularly in high-profile cases like the 2006 "Livedoor Incident," and is essential for solving computer crimes and data tampering. It plays a critical role in investigations by thoroughly analyzing digital devices to uncover the truth.

FRONTEO's forensic investigation service consists of five steps, and it provides speedy, high-quality service at every step:

- Interview: Hearing about the details of the problem (incident) by phone or through inquiry form to conclude an investigation plan and provide an estimate for the investigation costs.

- Evidence Preservation: Safely preserve all data, including deleted data, such as various documents, emails, chat histories, etc., from the PCs, smartphones, and tablets that are the subject of the investigation in an unalterable format that meets "international standards of evidentiary value".

- Investigation: FRONTEO's AI, "KIBIT," can analyze and recover data, even if it has been deleted or encrypted. The system restores erased files and decrypts password-protected data to find evidence. Additionally, FRONTEO's advanced technology enables the secure collection of data, even in regions with strict data export regulations like the U.S. or South Korea. By using techniques such as hashing, sensitive information is made unreadable to third parties, ensuring privacy during the investigation.

- Review: scrutinize the highly relevant emails and documents identified by our in-house developed AI "KIBIT" to discover "truly relevant evidence".

- Report: prepare an "international standard report" on the contents of the investigation

### FRONTEO Data Preservation

FRONTEO Data Preservation completely replicate data from former employees' PCs, mobile devices, etc. and store them in a safe environment. This enables FRONTEO to quickly investigate fraud and secure useful evidence in the event of a fraud investigation, such as "information leaks or the removal of trade secrets by former employees". Another advantage of "Preservation of Former Employee PCs and Mobile Devices" is that if a suspected information leak occurs, a forensic investigation can be started immediately without having to prepare new data, since a complete copy is preserved within FRONTEO. This is a major advantage in cases of information leaks, where a quick response is essential.
